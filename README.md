Project name: Auto Answer

State: released

This project is based on the source code found at http://code.google.com/p/auto-answer/ released under a GNU GPL v3 licence http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

Since the author never released it on Google's Play Store, I catered it to my needs last year to add that setting to my LG Optimus HUB which didn't have it (LG thing I was told).
It works perfectly, I tested it on Android Gingerbread 2.3.6 and Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3 (LG Optimus L7), but should work on Froyo 2.2 too.

At the time there weren't many free apps that did this but now you have some choices - https://play.google.com/store/search?q=autoanswer&c=apps

The licence remains the same: GNU GPL v3.
